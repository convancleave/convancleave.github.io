				The world doesn't need another drum lesson website. The amount of exercises, licks, and drum lessons out there is overwhelming. We have all of these tools and little to no guidance on how to use them. The truth is, <i>what</i> you practice is less important than <i>how</i> you practice.

					The Van Cleave Method is an approach to practicing that draws on the wisdom of many different domains, including the study of other instruments, strength training, sports, martial arts, and many other artistic and techincal pursuits.
